# üß¨ ATC Terminology Publisher

This repository automatically publishes the latest **ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System)** terminology every week. The resulting file, [`atc-codesystem.csv`](./atc-codesystem.csv), is intended to be used in healthcare applications that rely on up-to-date medication classification data.

## üöÄ How It Works

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/update-atc.yml`) runs **every Monday at 6:00 UTC** and performs the following steps:

1. Downloads and extracts the data processing script from  
   [`sarrabenyahia/webscrap_health_monitoring`](https://github.com/sarrabenyahia/webscrap_health_monitoring)
2. Installs the required Python dependencies.
3. Executes the script that downloads and converts the official ATC/DDD Excel file.
4. Converts the Excel file to a CSV file using `ssconvert`.
5. Replaces the existing `atc-codesystem.csv` file with the newly generated version.
6. Commits and pushes the updated CSV file to the repository.

This repository is part of the [eHealth Platform Standards initiative](https://github.com/ehealthplatformstandards) and is used in the workflow of  
üëâ [`ehealthplatformstandards/atc-terminology-publisher`](https://github.com/ehealthplatformstandards/atc-terminology-publisher)

## üì¶ Output

- `atc-codesystem.csv`: The latest ATC terminology in CSV format, regenerated weekly.

## üìÖ Schedule

The workflow is scheduled as follows:

```yaml
cron: '0 6 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 6:00 UTC
````

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements (Handled by the workflow)

* Python 3
* `pip`
* `gnumeric` (for `ssconvert`)
* `wget`, `unzip`

These are automatically installed inside the GitHub Actions runner during execution.
